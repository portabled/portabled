Effectively an Operation System in an HTML file
===================================

intro:

* Ready to use ANYWHERE
* Supports node.js, bash
* Portable

---

Platforms, containers, Operating Systems, browsers... explosion [FUCK!]
 -- how do you cope?
 > tests
 > frameworks
 > more tests, VIRTUALISE!, more frameworks, TRANSPILE! FUCK! FUCK!!
 > drink, heavy drink, failure, RETIREMENT

This gives you a fix for EVERYTHING.
* one HTML file
* no server
* no installation
* no "simple steps to get it up and running"
* ultimately portable
* universally supported
* 1Mb

WYG:
=====

* RUN node.js
* RUN bash
* filesystem
* http/https

Bedrock-solid platform, that seals whole of your setup in a single HTML file, everything-included.


Look, it works on iPhone
-- and on iPad
-- and that brilliant Samsung
-- and this shitface phone
-- and this hideous old laptop
-- see: IE6, it works here too (man this one is sad little computer)


You can write your apps, scripts and automation. You can debug it, you can do it balancing on one leg in the crowded train. n
