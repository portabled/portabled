# Markdown Document

How can you view, edit and pass around a document in a stable, practical way? Never worry
about formats, encodings, parts and versions? And use on any device: table, computer, phone,
old dusty PC in an internet cafe in a godforsaken country half a world away?

This is how...

## You can save this document

Click or tap anywhere on this document, and choose 'Save' button from the title.

You get one file, in simple, straightforward web format. Stash it. Send it. Copy it. It's just a single file,
just as your favourite word processor would create.

## You can edit this document

Choose 'Edit' button in the title (click or tap if title is hidden). Conventional, self-documenting Markdown syntax is supported.
For cheatsheet look in the title again.

As you edit, the document's internal logic keeps persisting your changes automatically in a local cache.
So even if you close the window, or shut the phone or tablet down -- nothing is lost.
Just open the same page and your edits are still there. Simple.

## You can open this document on any device

Yes, it works on iOS, on Android, on PC and Mac. Even on your smart TV or a Blackberry your employer insists on you having.

Even the unfamous IE6 is supported, and works surprisingly fast and smooth.

## How does it work?

Funny you should ask for such things early in the morning.

 - 1 One
 - 2 Two
 - 3 Three
 - 4 Four
 - 5 Five
 - 6 Six

more of the same?
